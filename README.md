# Generating impactful vs non-impactful goal metrics
### All Data is sourced from FBRef (https://fbref.com/en/) 
**The work from metrics-notebook.ipynb can be used to generate data from any season and any competition listed on FBRef.** <br>
This project came as a result of a lot of debate among the footballing community that certain players tend to score goals when it did not matter and because of this their stats did not actually reflect proper impactful goal contributions (i.e. Harry Kane's 4 goals vs. San Marino to bring the score to 6-0). <br>
Because of this I have built parameters for whether or not a goal has been impactful or not, judged based on timing of goal the goal, and the difference it made in score.<br>
**Initial site pages fed into scrape_data function must be from the Scores & Fixtures Pages.**<br>
*i.e. fbref > competitions > *any league or competition from any year** > scores and fixtures
